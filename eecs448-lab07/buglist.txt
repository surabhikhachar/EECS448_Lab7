Bugs List:
1. The isEmpty cannot successfully determine if a list is empty or not.
  - It always returns true for some reason.
2. removeFront() does not remove from the front of the list like it is supposed to.
  - When a value is removed from a list it does not return true.
  - Does not reduce the size by 1 when an element is removed from the list.
3. removeBack() seems to have similar problems to removeFront():
  - it does not reduce the size by 1 when something is removed.
  - Doesn't properly return true when an item gets removed from the list.
4. addBack() inserts an element in the incorrect position of the list.
